# RNAUnfolding
These are the codes required to study the unfolding kinetics of RNA hairpin architectures in response to an applied external field
1. buildSystem folder contains codes (1)to generate data file and input file of our system, (2) equilibrate the system. 
2. efield120mV_22HP folder contains codes to run the simulation for 22HP model and 120 mV applied electric field.
